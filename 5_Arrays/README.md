#  JavaScript prework - Arrays

#### Guidelines:

* do all exercises from this section in the script.js file,
* separate exercises with comments,
* remember to define different variable names in each exercise so they do not overwrite each other!
  (excluding loops where we use ```i``` or ```j``` interchangeably)


#### Exercise 1

In script.js create an array with three elements, e.g. numbers. Then, write all elements of this array in the console.

#### Exercise 2

In script.js create an array with a list of your favorite fruit. Then:

1. Write the first fruit in the console.
2. Write the last fruit in the console (use the length attribute).
3. Write all the fruit in a loop (use the length attribute).

#### Exercise 3

In script.js create an array with 10 numbers of your choice and a variable named ```sum```. Assign number 0 to the sum. Using a ```for``` loop, write the sum of all array elements.

#### Exercise 4

In script.js create an array with 10 numbers of your choice. In a ```for``` loop, check which ones are even.
write the sum of all even numbers in the console.


#### Exercise 5

In script.js create an array with 10 numbers of your choice and a variable named  ```max```. Assign 0 to max. In a ```for``` loop, find the greatest number, assign it to ```max``` and write it in the console.

#### Exercise 6

In script.js create an array with 10 numbers of your choice (let some of the values repeat) and a variable named ```firstIndex```. In a ```for``` loop, check which number repeats first and assign its index to ```firstIndex```. Then, write this variable in the console - outside the ```for``` loop.

Example of an array:

```JavaScript
 var arrWithNumbers = [2,4,5,2,3,5,1,2,4];
 ```

2 repeats first in this array so ```firstIndex``` should be 0 because 2 is the first number in the array.
Test your script with different values in the array.
Hint: remember to break the loop appropriately.

#### Exercise 7

In script.js create an array with 10 numbers of your choice. Using a ```for``` loop, write it in the reversed order - from the last element to the first.

#  JavaScript prework - Variables and data types

#### Guidelines:

* do all exercises from this section in the script.js file,
* separate exercises with comments,
* remember to define different variable names in each exercise so they do not overwrite each other!


#### Exercise 1
In script.js create 6 variables. Assign the following data to them:

* number
* string
* number + string, e.g. (2 + "two")
* logical value
* special value

Add a comment to each variable saying what kind of data it stores (use ```typeof``` operator to check the type) and write values of these variables in the console.

Example:
```JavaScript
var numberOfUsers = 23;
console.log(numberOfUsers);
console.log(typeof numberOfUsers);
//This variable type is number, and it stores the value of 23
```

#### Exercise 2
In script.js create three variables:
* two of them should store any numbers,
* the last named ```result``` should store the number 0.
Next, save the sum of the first two variables in the ```result``` variable. Write the result in the console.


#### Exercise 3
In script.js create a variable and do not assign anything to it. Then, write it in the console.Write in a comment what value was written in the console.

#  JavaScript prework - Your first script

#### Guidelines:

* do all exercises from this section in the script.js file,
* separate exercises with comments,
* remember to define different variable names in each exercise so they do not overwrite each other!!

#### Exercise 1

Write the following instruction in script.js:

```JavaScript
console.log("Your name");
```

Open index.html in your browser (preferably Chrome) and check the console.
Note how the JavaScript file was added to the HTML document.

#### Exercise 2

If you still have the console open, try to write several arithmetical operations in it, e.g.:

```JavaScript
*  2 + 3;
* 10 / 4;
* 30 * 2;
```

End every instruction pressing Enter.
Note that in the console you do not have to use console.log().


#### Exercise 3

Try to write the following code lines in the console and see what is displayed:

```
*  "Hello World";
*   Hello World;
*  "Hello World;
```

In a comment in script.js write what the console displayed after each instruction was given.

#  JavaScript prework - Operators

#### Guidelines:

* do all exercises from this section in the script.js file,
* separate exercises with comments,
* remember to define different variable names in each exercise so they do not overwrite each other!

#### Exercise 1

In script.js create two variables and assign two known logical values to them. Compare them in the console using the ```==``` operator.
Write your observations in a comment.

#### Exercise 2

In script.js create three variables. Two of them should store any numbers, and the third named ```resultModulo``` should store the number 0. Calculate the remainder (modulo) after dividing the numbers from parameters and save the result in a variable ```resultModulo```.
Write the ```resultModulo``` variable in the console. Remember that ```var``` is used only when creating a variable.

#### Exercise 3
In script.js create three variables. Two of them should store strings, and the third one named ```joinedStrings``` should store an empty string, e.g. ```var joinedStrings = ""```
Join the strings using concatenation (+) and write the result in the ```joinedStrings``` variable. Write it in the console.


#### Exercise 4
In script.js create two variables:

 ``` JavaScript
var myNumber = 4;
var myString = "4";
 ```

Compare these variables using ```==``` and ```===```.
Write the results in the console. Write your observations in a comment.


#### Exercise 5

In script.js create a variable named ```counter``` and assign the number 145 to it.
Write its value in the console, and then:

* using incrementation, increase the value of ```counter```
* write it in the console
* using decrementation, decrease the value of ```counter```
* write it in the console.


#### Exercise 6

In script.js create three variables. Two of them should store any numbers, and the third one named ```result``` should store ```null```. Check if the first number is greater than the other using an appropriate operator and save the result in the ```result``` variable. Write this variable in the console.
